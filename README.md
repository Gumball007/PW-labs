## Description

:trollface:  This repository contains laboratory works for **PW**. Probably, the only course that I'll enjoy here at UTM, as I am an UX/UI Designer and there haven't been any courses related at least to :sparkles: colors :sparkles: yet.

:exclamation:  Teacher [**Alexei Șerșun**](https://github.com/alexeisersun).
